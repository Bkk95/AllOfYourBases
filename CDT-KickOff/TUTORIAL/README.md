Tutorial: Gaussian Process Modelling in Python (Kepler Data)
---

This folder contains material for the STFC Data Intensive CDT Kick-Off tutorial on GPM in Python. There are two levels of tutorial depending on Python proficiency. Both use the dataset KIC1430163.tbl.

*Level*: **Beginner**
- KeplerLightCurve.ipynb - uses the **george** (v0.2.1) GPM library

A step by step guide can also be found here: https://allofyourbases.com/2017/09/23/spinning-stars/

*Level*: **Intermediate**
- KeplerLightCurveCelerite.ipynb - uses the **celerite** GPM library; includes MCMC optimization of hyper-parameters

A step by step guide can also be found here: https://allofyourbases.com/2017/10/02/spinning-stars-ii-celerite/
