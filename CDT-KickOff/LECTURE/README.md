---

This folder contains material for the STFC Data Intensive CDT Kick-Off lecture on GPM in Python. The reference text book for this lecture is Rasmussen & Williams: *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning*, a complete copy of which is freely available online here:

- http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/

There are two iPython scripts to accompany the lecture:

 - GPMIntro.ipynb
 - GPMCarbonDioxide.ipynb
 
 These scripts use the input data set:
 
 - mauna_loa.dat
 
 You can also find the contents of these scripts described here:
